Assigning a Value to a Name
---------------------------

In Python, as most programming languages, values may be assigned names,
which are often called variables or references. In Python, variable
names contain letters, numbers and underscores, and cannot start with a
number. Here are some valid variable names:

    my_number
    steve123
    X
    Y
    cRaZy
    _thing

In order to assign a value to a name, the assignment operator is used
which is an equal sign (=). Then you can use the variable name in place
of the value itself.

    >>> a = 10
    >>> a
    10
    >>> print(a)
    10
    >>> a + 20
    30
    >>> a / 2
    5.0

Variables may be reassigned later to hold different values, even
different types of values.

    >>> print(name)
    Steve
    >>> name = "Bob"
    >>> print(name)
    Bob
    >>> name = 100
    >>> name / 10
    10.0
