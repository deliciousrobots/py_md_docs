Truth and Falsehood
-------------------

So far we've seen numerical types (integers and floats) and strings.
There is another important fundamental type in Python which is called
Boolean or bool. It has one of two values, *True* or *False*. These
values represent truth and falsehood. You can use them directly by using
their keywords:

    >>> y = True
    >>> y
    True
    >>> print(y)
    True
    >>> type(y)
    <class 'bool'>

Boolean values respond to logical operators:

    >>> True and False
    False
    >>> True and True
    True
    >>> False and True
    False
    >>> False or True
    True

Boolean Expressions
-------------------

There are a number of expressions, usually comparisons of some type that
result in a Boolean value. Some of these you might remember from math
class.
